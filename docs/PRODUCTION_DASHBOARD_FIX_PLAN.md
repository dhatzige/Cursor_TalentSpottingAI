# Production Dashboard Fix Plan

## Problem Summary
- Users complete onboarding but dashboard shows mock data
- Clerk user IDs may not match database user IDs
- Authentication allows access to dashboards even after logout
- Mock data fallbacks exist throughout the codebase

## Root Causes
1. **ID Mismatch**: Clerk generates new IDs that don't match existing database records
2. **Incomplete Sync**: The Clerk webhook sync doesn't properly handle all cases
3. **Mock Data Fallbacks**: Production code contains development-only mock data
4. **Authentication Gaps**: Middleware doesn't properly enforce authentication

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Fix Authentication (Priority 1)
**Goal**: Ensure proper authentication and logout behavior

1. **Update Middleware** (`frontend/src/middleware.ts`)
   - Add proper authentication checks
   - Clear all auth cookies on logout
   - Redirect to home page after logout

2. **Fix useProtectedRoute Hook**
   - Remove dev_bypass from production builds
   - Add proper session validation
   - Handle expired tokens correctly

3. **Add Logout Handler**
   - Create proper logout flow that clears Clerk session
   - Ensure all protected routes check authentication

### Phase 2: Fix Data Sync (Priority 2)
**Goal**: Ensure all users have proper database records

1. **Enhance Clerk Sync Endpoint** (`backend/src/controllers/clerk.controller.ts`)
   - Handle ID mismatches gracefully
   - Create student profile automatically if missing
   - Log all sync operations for debugging

2. **Add Webhook Handler**
   - Set up Clerk webhook for user.created events
   - Automatically create database records for new users
   - Handle user.updated events for profile changes

3. **Create Migration Script**
   ```typescript
   // backend/scripts/migrate-clerk-users.ts
   // Script to sync all existing Clerk users to database
   ```

### Phase 3: Remove Mock Data (Priority 3)
**Goal**: Eliminate all mock data from production code

1. **Backend Changes**
   - Remove mock data from all controllers
   - Return proper empty states with correct HTTP codes
   - Add proper error messages

2. **Frontend Changes**
   - Remove STUDENT_MOCK_DATA and all mock constants
   - Remove mock data fallbacks in services
   - Add proper loading and empty states

### Phase 4: Improve Onboarding (Priority 4)
**Goal**: Ensure onboarding always creates valid database records

1. **Add Transaction Safety**
   - Wrap all onboarding operations in database transactions
   - Add proper rollback on failures
   - Log all operations for debugging

2. **Add Verification Step**
   - After onboarding, verify database record exists
   - Show confirmation that profile was created
   - Provide retry mechanism if failed

## Implementation Checklist

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Fix Clerk sync endpoint to handle all edge cases
- [ ] Remove all mock data returns from controllers
- [ ] Add proper logging to all profile operations
- [ ] Create user migration script
- [ ] Set up Clerk webhooks
- [ ] Add health check endpoint for profile verification

### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] Fix middleware authentication checks
- [ ] Remove dev_bypass from production
- [ ] Remove all mock data constants and fallbacks
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Improve loading states
- [ ] Add profile verification after onboarding

### DevOps Tasks
- [ ] Set up Clerk webhook endpoint
- [ ] Add monitoring for failed profile creations
- [ ] Create backup/restore procedures
- [ ] Add alerts for authentication failures

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- Test Clerk sync with various ID scenarios
- Test profile creation with missing data
- Test authentication flows

### Integration Tests
- Full onboarding flow test
- Login/logout flow test
- Profile update test

### E2E Tests
- New user signup → onboarding → dashboard
- Existing user login → dashboard → logout
- Profile completion flow

## Rollout Plan

1. **Development Environment**
   - Implement all fixes
   - Run full test suite
   - Manual testing with multiple accounts

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Deploy fixes to staging
   - Test with production-like data
   - Load testing for performance

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy during low-traffic period
   - Monitor error rates
   - Have rollback plan ready

## Success Metrics

- Zero mock data displayed in production
- 100% of users have database records
- Logout properly clears authentication
- No 404 errors on profile endpoints
- Profile completion rate > 80%

## Timeline

- Week 1: Fix authentication and remove mock data
- Week 2: Implement proper data sync and webhooks
- Week 3: Testing and staging deployment
- Week 4: Production deployment and monitoring
