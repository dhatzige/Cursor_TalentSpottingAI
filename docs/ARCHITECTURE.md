## Frontend Architecture

### Modular Component Pattern

The frontend codebase follows a strict modular component pattern to ensure maintainability, code reuse, and adherence to the 300-400 line limit rule. Each UI page is broken down into smaller, focused components that handle specific aspects of the functionality.

#### Component Structure

1. **Page Components** - Top-level components that:
   - Handle data fetching and state management
   - Orchestrate the layout of child components
   - Manage routing and navigation
   - Connect to services and API calls

2. **Feature Components** - Mid-level components that:
   - Implement specific feature functionality
   - Handle local state management
   - Delegate rendering to presentation components

3. **Presentation Components** - Low-level, reusable UI components that:
   - Focus on visual representation
   - Accept props for data display
   - Trigger callbacks for user interactions
   - Have minimal or no internal state

4. **Utility Components** - Shared components that:
   - Provide common functionality (loading states, error messages)
   - Enforce consistent UI patterns
   - Can be reused across multiple features

#### Directory Structure

```
src/app/[feature-area]/[specific-feature]/
├── page.tsx                    # Main page component
├── components/                 # Feature-specific components
│   ├── index.ts                # Consolidated exports
│   ├── types.ts                # Shared type definitions
│   ├── FeatureComponent.tsx    # Feature components
│   ├── [sub-feature]/          # Grouped sub-feature components
│   │   ├── SubComponent1.tsx
│   │   └── SubComponent2.tsx
```

#### Component Communication

Components communicate primarily through:
1. **Props** - For parent-to-child communication
2. **Callbacks** - For child-to-parent communication
3. **Context** - For cross-component state sharing (when needed)

### Examples

#### Application Page Modularity

The Applications page in the Organization Dashboard has been refactored into these components:

```
organization-dashboard/applications/
├── page.tsx                   # Main page handling data & state
├── components/                
│   ├── index.ts               # Consolidated exports
│   ├── ApplicationsHeader.tsx # Page header with job info
│   ├── StatusFilter.tsx       # Application status filtering
│   ├── ErrorDisplay.tsx       # Error message display
│   ├── ComparisonControl.tsx  # Comparison feature controls
│   ├── ApplicationsContent.tsx # Main layout container
│   ├── loading/
│   │   └── LoadingState.tsx   # Loading indicator
│   ├── empty/
│   │   ├── NoApplicationsState.tsx   # Empty state
│   │   └── NoSelectedApplicationState.tsx  # No selection
```

## Backend Architecture

### Controller Modularity

The backend follows a similar modular approach where each controller is broken down into smaller, focused functions that adhere to the 300-400 line limit rule.

#### Service Layer Pattern

Services are organized by domain function:
```
services/
├── employer/
│   ├── index.ts               # Main export
│   ├── jobs-service.ts        # Job posting operations
│   ├── applications-service.ts # Application management
│   ├── talent-search-service.ts # Candidate search
│   └── dashboard-service.ts   # Statistics and summaries
```

## TypeScript Best Practices

1. **Explicit Type Definitions**
   - Create interface or type definitions for all data structures
   - Export and reuse types across components
   - Use explicit return types for functions

2. **Type Safety in API Calls**
   - Define explicit types for request and response objects
   - Use type guards for response validation
   - Handle edge cases with union types

3. **Avoiding Implicit Any**
   - Always provide explicit types for parameters
   - Use TypeScript's built-in utility types when appropriate
   - Enable strict mode in the TypeScript config

## Performance Considerations

1. **Component Rendering Optimization**
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implement virtualization for long lists
   - Lazy load components when appropriate

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Split code by route using Next.js dynamic imports
   - Separate vendor code from application code
   - Preload critical resources

## Integration Testing Strategy

1. **Component Testing**
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Mock dependencies and services
   - Verify component behavior with different props

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test component integration with service layer
   - Verify proper data flow between components
   - Test user flows across multiple components

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete user journeys
   - Verify application behavior in a production-like environment
   - Focus on critical paths and high-value features

## Conclusion

This modular architecture enables the team to:
1. Maintain a clean and organized codebase
2. Scale development across multiple developers
3. Reuse components across different features
4. Test components in isolation
5. Improve performance through targeted optimizations

By following these patterns consistently, we ensure that the codebase remains maintainable and scalable as the application grows.
