## 2025-01-13 Profile Completion Step - Comprehensive Skills System & Accurate Profile Summary

### Summary
Completely rebuilt the final onboarding step with two major improvements: 1) Fixed profile summary to display actual user data instead of placeholders, and 2) Created a comprehensive skills system with 500+ skills, intelligent autocomplete, and personalized recommendations based on academic level and field of study.

### Problems Solved

#### 1. Inaccurate Profile Summary
- **Issue**: Profile summary showed "Selected University" instead of actual university name
- **Impact**: Users couldn't verify their information before submission
- **Root Cause**: ProfileStep component wasn't receiving university data from onboarding state

#### 2. Basic Skills Input System
- **Issue**: Simple text field that students would likely skip
- **Impact**: Incomplete profiles with no skills data
- **Research**: Students don't know what skills they have or how to describe them

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Accurate Profile Summary âœ…
- **University Data Flow**: Added university fetching to onboarding page and passed selected university object to ProfileStep
- **Complete Information Display**: Shows actual university name, city, graduation year, study details, skills count, and bio preview
- **Real-time Updates**: Profile summary updates as users modify their information

#### 2. Comprehensive Skills Ecosystem âœ…

**Skills Database (500+ skills across 18 categories):**
```typescript
// Categories include:
- Programming Languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)
- Web Development (React, Node.js, Angular, etc.)
- Data Science & Analytics (Machine Learning, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Business & Management, Marketing & Sales
- Healthcare & Medical, Engineering, Science & Research
- Arts & Humanities, Communication & Languages
- And 11 more specialized categories
```

**Intelligent Recommendations System:**
- **Academic Level Based**: Different recommendations for Bachelor's, Master's, PhD students
- **Field-Specific**: Computer Science students see "JavaScript, Python, Data Structures"
- **General Skills**: All levels get "Communication, Teamwork, Problem Solving"
- **Smart Mapping**: Automatically maps study fields to relevant skill categories

**Advanced User Experience:**
- **Real-time Autocomplete**: Instant suggestions as users type
- **Tag-based Selection**: Visual skill badges with easy removal
- **One-click Recommendations**: Students can add suggested skills with single click
- **Smart Search**: Prioritized matching (exact â†’ starts-with â†’ contains)
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected skills show as green checkmarks in recommendations

## 2025-06-21 Authentication Redirect Loop Fix

### Summary
Fixed critical redirect loop issue where authenticated users couldn't access their dashboards due to authentication system conflicts between frontend (Clerk) and backend (JWT).

### Root Cause
- **Frontend**: Using Clerk authentication with Clerk tokens
- **Backend**: Expecting JWT tokens via `authenticateToken` middleware
- **Result**: API calls failed with 401 errors â†’ triggered redirect loops between `/sign-in`, `/onboarding`, and `/student-dashboard`

### Solution Implemented
1. **Backend Routes Update**: Changed `backend/src/routes/student.routes.ts` to use `clerkAuth` middleware instead of `authenticateToken`
2. **Frontend API Service**: Modified `frontend/src/lib/api/student.service.ts` to accept and use Clerk `getToken` function
3. **Student Dashboard**: Updated `frontend/src/app/student-dashboard/page.tsx` to pass `getToken` from `useAuth()` hook to all API calls
4. **Middleware Simplification**: Streamlined `frontend/src/middleware.ts` to avoid server-client conflicts

### Technical Details
```typescript
// Before: JWT-based authentication
router.use(authenticateToken, authorizeRoles(['student']));

// After: Clerk-based authentication  
router.use(clerkAuth);

// Frontend service calls now include token
StudentService.getDashboardStats(getToken)
```

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/routes/student.routes.ts` - Switched to clerkAuth middleware
- `frontend/src/lib/api/student.service.ts` - Added getToken parameter to all methods
- `frontend/src/app/student-dashboard/page.tsx` - Added useAuth hook and token passing
- `frontend/src/lib/api/axios.ts` - Simplified token handling
- `frontend/src/middleware.ts` - Streamlined redirect logic
- `frontend/src/lib/hooks/useProtectedRoute.tsx` - Enhanced client-side auth handling

### Testing Verified
- âœ… No more redirect loops
- âœ… Student dashboard loads successfully
- âœ… API calls authenticate properly with Clerk tokens
- âœ… Role-based redirects work correctly
- âœ… Public routes remain accessible

### Key Learnings
- **Server-side vs Client-side Auth**: Avoid conflicts by clearly separating concerns
- **Token Consistency**: Frontend and backend must use the same authentication system
- **Debugging Strategy**: Use console logs and network inspection to identify auth failures

## 2025-06-18 UI Redesign: FeatureCarousel Component

### Summary
- Added reusable `FeatureCarousel` component (`frontend/src/components/home/FeatureCarousel.tsx`).
- Replaced legacy coloured feature grids on landing pages (Employers, Students, Universities) with the new carousel.
- Removed duplicate/legacy markup sections and the `.hero-bg-animation` overlay divs.

### Usage Snippet
```tsx
import FeatureCarousel from '@/components/home/FeatureCarousel';

const FEATURES = [
  { icon: 'ðŸ¤–', title: 'AI Talent Matching', description: 'Our algorithm finds perfect candidates.' },
  { icon: 'ðŸ“ˆ', title: 'Advanced Analytics', description: 'Track hiring metrics in real-time.' },
  // ...
];

<FeatureCarousel features={FEATURES} />
```

### Outstanding Tasks
1. Remove unused `.hero-bg-animation` CSS from stylesheets.
2. Resolve remaining ESLint `any`-type warnings.
3. Consider adding gentle fade-in or auto-scroll animations to the carousel.
