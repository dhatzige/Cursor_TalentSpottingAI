# TalentSpottingAI - Project Status Update

## Recent Updates

### Student Email Verification (In Progress - June 2025)

- **Objective**: To ensure users selecting the 'Student' role have a valid university-affiliated email address.
- **Current Status**: Partially implemented. The feature is not yet complete and should not be considered production-ready.
- **Components Created**:
  - `frontend/src/lib/university-domains.ts`: A utility file containing a list of valid university email domains and a helper function to check emails against it.
  - `frontend/src/app/api/verify-email/route.ts`: A server-side API endpoint to securely verify the logged-in user's primary email address.
- **Components Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`: The onboarding page was updated to call the new verification API when the student role is selected. It includes basic error handling to display feedback to the user.
- **Known Issues**:
  - The API route (`verify-email/route.ts`) currently has TypeScript errors related to incorrect usage of the Clerk server-side SDK, which prevent it from functioning correctly.
  - The feature requires finishing and testing before it can be merged.

  - The feature requires finishing and testing before it can be merged.

### Authentication & Onboarding Overhaul (June 2025)

- **Server-Side Authentication with Clerk Middleware**:
  - Implemented a robust, `async` server-side middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) using Clerk v4's `clerkMiddleware`.
  - Resolved persistent TypeScript and runtime errors by correctly using `await auth()` to handle the asynchronous nature of session retrieval.
  - The middleware now reliably protects routes and enforces role-based access control across the entire application.

- **Intelligent Role-Based Redirects**:
  - The middleware correctly redirects authenticated users to their respective dashboards (`/student-dashboard`, `/organization-dashboard`, etc.) based on the `role` stored in their Clerk user metadata.
  - Users without a role are automatically sent to the `/onboarding` page to complete their registration.
  - Logged-in users are prevented from accessing public-only pages like `/sign-in` or `/sign-up`.

- **Onboarding Redirect Loop Fix**:
  - Refactored the onboarding page (`src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`) to eliminate a critical bug where users were repeatedly sent back to select a role.
  - Implemented a `useEffect` hook that checks for an existing role on page load. If a role is present, the user is automatically redirected to their dashboard, completely bypassing the role selection UI.
  - This ensures a seamless user experience, where role selection is a one-time action.


### UI Component & Auth Refactoring (June 2025)

- **UI Component Migration**:
  - Replaced legacy UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Tabs`) with modern `shadcn/ui` equivalents across the application.
  - Refactored JSX to use compound components (`CardHeader`, `CardContent`, etc.) for improved modularity and maintainability.
- **Shared UI Components Centralization**:
  - Migrated all shared dashboard components (e.g., `ChartContainer`, `Pagination`) to a new centralized directory: `src/components/dashboard/shared`.
  - Removed the deprecated legacy `src/app/organization-dashboard/shared` directory structure.
- **Authentication Hook Consolidation**:
  - Consolidated all route protection logic into a single, canonical `useProtectedRoute` hook powered by Clerk, located at `src/lib/hooks/useProtectedRoute.tsx`.
  - Deleted legacy and mock authentication hooks to reduce technical debt and unify the auth flow.
- **Documentation Overhaul**:
  - Updated `README.md`, `CLIENT_SIDE_HOOKS.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the new component architecture, centralized shared components, and the unified Clerk-based authentication strategy.


### Automated Backend Testing Setup (June 2025)

- **Testing scaffold added** using Jest, ts-jest and SuperTest.
  - Config files: `backend/jest.config.ts`, `backend/tests/setupTests.ts`.
  - Dev-dependencies added to `backend/package.json`.
- **Refactor**: Express app split into `src/app.ts` (pure app) and `src/server.ts` (bootstrap + graceful shutdown). NPM scripts updated.
- **Initial test suites**:
  - `tests/health.test.ts` – checks `/api/health` returns 200.
  - `tests/student/applyForJob.test.ts` – validates cover-letter length, duplicate prevention, and success path (Prisma mocked).
- **Result**: `npm test` now passes (2 suites, 4 tests) and baseline unit-test coverage raised.


### Global Dark Mode Enforcement (June 2025)

- **Enforced permanent dark mode** across entire frontend.
  - Added `className="dark"` on `<html>` in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.
  - Removed preference-loading script for theme.
- **Theme utilities updated** in `frontend/src/lib/theme.ts` to always apply and persist dark mode.
- **Removed dark mode toggle UI** by stubbing `AppearanceSection` and eliminating toggle entries in student, organization, and university dashboard settings pages.
- **Verified** dark theme in major browsers; Windsurf Browser preview appears white due to iframe limitation—no action required.


### Dashboard Settings Save Flow & Notification Cleanup (June 2025)

- **Removed SMS Notification toggles** from both Student & Employer settings pages; unified under `weeklySummary` email setting.
- Introduced **`useSaveSettings` hook** (`frontend/src/lib/hooks/useSaveSettings.ts`): generic persistence util returning `{ saveSettings, saving, saved }`.
- Added **mock API route** `frontend/src/app/api/settings/route.ts` that logs the incoming settings JSON for now.
- Integrated hook + **dirty flag UI** into:
  - `student-dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
  - `organization-dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
  Buttons now disabled until changes occur, display "Saving… → Saved!" status.
- Updated **README.md** with quick-start, dev_bypass explanation and save-flow docs.

### Dashboard Modularity Strategy
Each dashboard follows a modular pattern to prevent large files and enable reuse:

1. **Base Layout**: `DashboardLayout.tsx` provides the shell with role-specific styling and navigation.
2. **Page Component**: Each dashboard page (e.g., `admin-dashboard/page.tsx`) is kept minimal, primarily composing other components.
3. **Feature Components**: Dashboard elements are split into focused feature components (e.g., `DashboardStats.tsx`, `ActivityFeed.tsx`).
4. **Shared UI Elements**: Common patterns like stat cards and lists are extracted into the shared dashboard component directory.

This approach ensures no file exceeds 300-400 lines while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

### Color System
Interim color palette using Tailwind's built-in colors until the original project's exact theme is extracted:

- **Primary:** blue-600/700 (buttons, links, headings)
- **Secondary:** gray-200/300 (secondary buttons, backgrounds)
- **Role Colors:**
  - Admin: gray-800 (sidebar), blue-600 (accents)
  - Student: blue-700 (sidebar), blue-600 (accents)
  - Employer: green-700 (sidebar), blue-600 (accents)
  - University: purple-700 (sidebar), blue-600 (accents)
- **Status Colors:**
  - Success: green-600 (text), green-100 (bg)
  - Warning: yellow-600 (text), yellow-100 (bg)
  - Error: red-600 (text), red-100 (bg)
  - Default: gray-600 (text), gray-100 (bg)
- **Text:** gray-800 (headings), gray-600 (body), white (on dark backgrounds)

## Frontend: Screenshot-to-Route Mapping
All major UI pages are scaffolded as modular Next.js components, each referencing the corresponding screenshot and the original GitHub repo for visual fidelity. Each page/component is kept under 300–400 lines for maintainability.

| Screenshot                | Route Path                | Component File                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|

## Backend Architecture

### API Structure
The backend follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

| Component | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Routes | Define API endpoints | Express Router modules |
| Controllers | Business logic | Role-specific controller files |
| Middleware | Request processing | Authentication, authorization, error handling |
| Database | Data storage | Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL |

### Authentication System
A complete JWT-based authentication system has been implemented:

- **Token Generation:** JWT tokens contain user ID and role for secure, stateless authentication
- **Middleware:** `authenticateToken` middleware validates tokens on protected routes
- **Role-Based Authorization:** `authorizeRoles` middleware restricts access based on user roles
- **User Management:** Registration, login, and profile endpoints for all user operations

### Role-Based Controllers
Each user role has dedicated controllers with tailored functionality:

| Role | Controller | Endpoints |
|------|------------|----------|
| Admin | admin.controller.ts | Dashboard stats, activity tracking |
| Student | student.controller.ts | Recommended jobs, application tracking |
| Employer | employer.controller.ts | Job management, candidate matching |
| University | university.controller.ts | Student metrics, placement data, employer partnerships |

### Database Models
The Prisma schema defines core models with relationships:

- **User:** Central entity with role-based access
- **Organization:** Companies hiring students
- **Job:** Position listings created by employers
- **Application:** Student applications to jobs with the following fields:
  - id: Unique identifier
  - jobId: Associated job
  - studentId: Applicant reference
  - status: Current stage (pending, reviewing, interview, accepted, rejected)
  - resume: Uploaded resume file
  - coverLetter: Student's statement of interest
  - feedback: Employer response/feedback
  - createdAt/updatedAt: Timestamp tracking

### Frontend-Backend Connection
The frontend dashboard pages connect to corresponding backend endpoints:

| Frontend Page | Backend Endpoint | Data Exchange |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Login/Register | `/api/auth/*` | User credentials, JWT token |
| Admin Dashboard | `/api/admin/dashboard/*` | Statistics, activity data |
| Student Dashboard | `/api/student/*` | Job recommendations, application status |
| Organization Dashboard | `/api/employer/*` | Active jobs, candidate matches |
| University Dashboard | `/api/university/*` | Student metrics, placement data |
